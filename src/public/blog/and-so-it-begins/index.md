I was thinking about launching a blog for a while. Initially, my aim was to get up and running with minimal effort. But the more I thought about it, the clearer it becameâ€”I didn't just want to _have_ a blog, I also just really wanted to _build_ one.

And so, that's what I did. Because what else are you supposed to do on Saturdays, right? Anyway... Just like that, the "minimal effort" plan turned into "let's build it all from scratch."

What excited me most about building my blog was the idea of having full control over every aspect of it, from the design to the technical implementation. There are still things I want to add and improve, but I'm happy enough with the result so far to put it online. Also, at some point, you just have to stop tinkering and start writing.

The primary focus of my blog will be on web development, design, and other technical things that interest me. I have several ideas for posts I want to write first. One of them is about how I built my blog, focusing on the design and technical decisions.

I'd like to conclude my first post with a brief personal introduction. My name is Tom, and I'm a front-end engineer passionate about designing and building creative solutions for the web. I've been into design and web development since I was a kid, and I'm fortunate enough to have turned my hobby into my career. I live in The Netherlands with my girlfriend, Stephanie, and we enjoy traveling, movies, and an occasional (and slightly competitive) game of Rummikub.
