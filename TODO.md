# TODO

- Different picture for light/dark mode
- See if I can change accent color, or browser color, etc. with fancy meta tags?
- Replace open-wc en web rollup plugins with my own?
  - Look into CSS modules?
- Look into Service Workers
- Custom keyboard focus styles for theme switch? (and the LinkedIn link?)
- The transition MS can be a CSS var.
